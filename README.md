This repo is home to the layer of the [StarDust](https://github.com/rbjones/StarDust/wiki) constellation which is concerned with the use oh Higher Order Logic for the construction and application of formal models of the real world, i.e. with formal science, engineering, and many other kinds of knowledge.
This is the vast majority of the knowledge about the world which we need to know to go about our lives or conduct our professions.
This level also includes how inputs from IOT sensors, or other sources are incorporated into formal models, and how inference from such models might yield trusted assertions testifying to the completion of stages in some "smart contract" or triggering some IOT actuator.

These problems are addressed through the formal deductive aparatus provided by HoLoTruth.
