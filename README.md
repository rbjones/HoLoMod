# SensAct

This repo is home to the layer of the StarDust constellation which is concerned with the representation of synthetic, a posteriori, contingent truth and its applications.
This is the vast majority of the knowledge about the world which we need to know to go about our lives or conduct our professions.
This level also includes how inputs from IOT sensors, or other sources are incorporated into formal models, and how inference from such models might yield trusted assertions testifying to the completion of stages in some "smart contract" or triggering some IOT actuator.

These problems are addressed through the formal deductive aparatus provided by DA-Hol.
